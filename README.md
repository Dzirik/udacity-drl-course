# Introduction
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

The base for this project is my personal data science/machine learning repository that is publicly available on 
my [GitHub](https://github.com/Dzirik/ds_ml_template) account.

I am fully aware of the fact, that for the Udacity project is it "overkill", but because I am planning to use the 
reinforcement learning for my project, I am developing the code so that it is compabible the environment I am used to 
use from the very beginning.

The goal of the project is to train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. 
Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around 
the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete 
actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 
100 consecutive episodes.

<a name="note"></a>
# IMPORTANT NOTE
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

In general, the problem with reinforcement learning (RL) course is, that I was not able to run basically any code 
given in the RL course repository locally without bigger or smaller changes. This became much more severe with the 
Navigation task, where I could not make the environment run locally on my machine. The help from Udacity forum was 
not helpful (if any, within a reasonable time frame).

Creating a code that I am not able to run on my own machine in my own environment violates reproducibility and as 
a consequence is not useful at all. So in the end I decided to do the project the following way to have both 
functional code in my environment and fulfill the requirements given by Udacity for passing the taks:

1. I developed the code using AI Gym environments and python environment that can be reproduced by following the 
Installation and Set Up sections in the readme file. The main code is in *notebooks/final/NAVIGATION_\*.py*. The code
and logic are explained in more details in the *Report.pdf* file. The final agent is train in the 
*NAVIGATION_02_double_q_agent_with_PER_training.py* notebook.
2. Afterwards, I copied all the necessary code hard-way into Udacity's Colab environment into the *Navigation.ipynb*
notebook and updated it to be functional within the environment. The code is not imported there but only copied. 
The reason is that I wanted to be fully transparent and reproducible, so no external unknown code imports. After 
the performance matched the criteria, the notebook was downloaded as a *\*.ipynb* file with several outputs in 
*\*.html* format to show the result. This, altogether with the model parameters for respective runs can be found in 
*/notebooks/colab* folder. **THIS CODE IS NOT WORKING WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT SPECIFIED IN THIS NOTEBOOK FOR THE 
REASON DESCRIBED ABOVE**. But I hope that this way everything is as much transparent as possible.

<a name="repository-set-up"></a>
# Repository Set Up
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Clone the repository and do the following to set it up properly:

1. Make a copy of a file *make_config_template.mk* and give it a name *make_config.mk*.
2. Open a console in the repository folder and put there `make hello` command. A welcome and congratulation message 
will show up.
3. In the console, run `make` or `make help`; a help showing all possible make commands will display.
4. In the console, run `make create-venv` to create a virtual environment with all necessary libraries.
5. Set up repository configuration. There are two configuration files available - */configurations/python_local.conf* and
*/configurations/python_repo.conf*. To change the default configuration, change the variable 
`DEFAULT_CONFIG` in location */src/global_constants*. In general, the code in the file */src/utils/envs.py* was developed
to set up global variables (not only) for configurations. A new configuration file can be created by the following steps:
    - Make a copy of *python_repo.conf* file.
    - Give it a suitable name (one name is already excluded for syncing with GitHub and then ready for your personal 
      usage - *python_personal.conf*).
    - Change a variable `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in location */src/global_constants* to make it the default configuration file.  
   
    The default value of `DEFAULT_CONFIG` is set to `python_personal`. So for everything to work correctly, please create 
*/configurations/python_personal.conf* file.
7. In the console, activate the virtual environment `.venv\Scripts\activate`.
8. Test the repository code running `make all -i`. All tests should run without any problem.
9. Create a playground notebook */notebooks/raw/playground_notebook.py*. This one is excluded from sync, so it can be 
used for testing and development.
10. The TensorFlow installation can be checked by running the notebook 
*/notebooks/documentation/tensorflow_installation_and_testing.py*.

# Code Quality
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

<a name="mypy"></a>
## Mypy
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. Execution time is reduced because types are checked before running.

To run mypy:
- Run the following command in command line `mypy --strict your_code.py --config-file mypy.ini`.
- See [*Makefile*](#makefile) for available commands.
    
A [mypy configuration file](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html) allows you to modify the setting for
 mypy. The file for this repository is */mypy.ini*.

Examples of static typing:
- Variable 
    - `x: str = "test"`
- Function
    - `def stringify(num: int) -> str: return str(num)`

See the [cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html#variables) for more annotation examples
 and options.
 
 *Tip: If you don't know which type should a callable be, write* `reveal_type(callable)` *in the code 
 and run mypy. The prompt will specify the type that you should use.*
 
 It is possible to ignore errors in 3 different ways:
 * On a line of code: By adding `# type:ignore` on that line.
 * On a .py file: By adding `# type:ignore` to the beginning of the file.
 * On config file: Disabling the settings of mypy such as `ignore_missing_imports=False`. However,
 ignoring in the file is not encouraged because it can suppress all the errors that can be helpful when debugging and also 
 they could be caused by another reason you want to ignore but give the same error.

**The following situations are excluded from checking. For more information, see the description below.**
- Pytest fixtures *Untyped decorator makes function "test_density" untyped :* in files *tests_**. 
It is excluded using:
    - `@pytest.mark.parametrize("df, type_of_normalisation", # type:ignore`
- Pytest fixture *Class cannot subclass 'BaseTransformer' (has type 'Any')*. 
It is excluded in the following style in the child class:
    - `class MyTransformer(BaseTransformer): # type:ignore`

### Excluded Situations
[ToC](#table-of-content)  
 
 Two types of error are ignored by adding `# type:ignore` to the regarding the line of code
 * Untyped decorator makes function "test_density" untyped: This is caused by the missing annotation 
  while using pytest fixtures or parametrization. It is impossible to use static typing for these; therefore,
  they cause a missing annotation when mypy is used. For example:
  `@pytest.mark.parametrize("transformation_type", [FP, P])  # type:ignore`
  * Class cannot subclass 'BaseTransformer' (has type 'Any') : This is possibly caused by the inheritance 
  of a different class in a different directory. Additional information is gathered by using `disallow_any_unimported = true`
   which gives "Base type BaseTransformer becomes "Any" due to an unfollowed import". Refer 
   [follow imports by mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running_mypy.html#follow-imports). 
   However, the real reason is not found. Several possible solutions that didn't solve the issue applied  
  are as follows:
    - Replace usage of `Any` with other built-in types.
    - Moving the inherited class into the same file.
    - Changing parameters from `Any` to other known ones.
    - Changing the number of parameters in the abstract file to be compatible with the overwritten file.
    - Disabling some of the error checking using config files such as `follow_imports=False`, 
    `follow_imports_for_stubs=False,True`, `disallow_untyped_defs=True,False`.  
    - Disabling all the inheritances in both existing files and inherited files.
    - Related materials can be found in the following links: [1](https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/1544), 
    [2](https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/1492), [3](https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/1446), 
    [4](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/4180), 
    [5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49888155/class-cannot-subclass-qobject-has-type-any-using-mypy)
    
    This issue is solved by adding `# type:ignore` to corresponding lines of code. For example:
    `class MyTransformer(BaseTransformer): # type:ignore`.

<a name="pylint"></a>
## Pylint
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Pylint is a static code analysis tool that:
- looks for programming errors,
- helps enforce a coding standard,
- sniffs for code smells,
- offers simple refactoring suggestions.

To run Pylint:
- Run the following command in command line `pylint your_code.py --rcfile .pylintrc`.
- See [*Makefile*](#makefile) for available commands.

It can also be executed within Python:

    import pylint.lint 
    pylint_opts = ['--version'] # --rcfile for using the configuration file, see user guide.   
    pylint.lint.Run(pylint_opts)

It has the option to do parallel execution to speed up the performance of Pylint.

See the [user guide](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/run.html) for more information. 

*Tip: To disable a warning for one single line (or block) you can type in the line or at the 
indentation level (e.g. a method or class) that you wish to disable the following 
comment:* `# pylint: disable=Warning-name-or-code`.

*Tip: When a warning is disabled by using `#pylint: disable=Warning-name-or-code.`, that particular type of checking
becomes disabled for the rest of the code starting from that line. Therefore, it is recommended to enable the same warning
after it is used for a specific part of code by using the command `#pylint: disable=Warning-name-or-code.`*

**The following situations were excluded from checking. For more information, see the description below.**
- Duplicate code. There are separate makes for that. Excluded from the main one.
- Parameters differ from overridden methods fit, fit_predict, predict. Because of problem in Base classes.  
    ```
    # pylint: disable=arguments-differ
    def fit(... 
        ... 
    def fit_predict(...  
        ...  
    def predict(...  
        ...  
        return ...
    # pylint: enable=arguments-differ
    ```
  
### Excluded Situations
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Overview
- too-many-arguments: If a number of arguments are bigger than five, then pylint gives an error. This type of
error is suppressed by `#pylint: disable=too-many-arguments` because sometimes it is necessary to use more 
than five arguments, and it is a design choice.
-too-few-public-methods: If a number of functions in a class is less than 2, then pylint gives an error.
This error is suppressed by using `#pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods` because it is a design choice.
- arguments-differ: Some abstract function's parameters are overridden in other classes while overriding 
the functions. When the number of parameters differs from the inherited function, pylint gives 
arguments-differ error. No solution was found for such an error therefore errors are suppressed by
`# pylint: disable=arguments-differ` and enabled checking after function by `# pylint: enable=arguments-differ`.

**Note:** Both _...disable..._ at the beginning of the code block, and _...enable..._ at the end of the code block
are used within the minimal possible scope.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: duplicate-code: Pylint gives an error for duplicate code. However, this code
can be written on purpose that way, and it is sometimes a design choice. Therefore, these errors can be
suppressed. However, disabling the duplicate-code error is not possible locally for pylint. 
Refer [here](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/214) for the issue. It is solved by disabling 
duplicate-code errors globally. It is needed to be careful about next time usages. At the same time, another 
make command together with a separate pylint configuration file was created to check the code for duplicities.

<a name="pytest"></a>
## Pytest
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Pytest is a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy.

To execute Pytest there are three ways:
- Test specific file by running `python -m pytest .\path\test_*.py`.
- See [*Makefile*](#makefile) for available commands for testing both the whole codebase and single file.
- (PyCharm) Through Python Integrated Tools (PIT):
    - Go to File -> Settings -> Tools -> PIT and change default tester to pytest.
    - Select the configuration pytest and run. 
    
There is an example in the repository there. There are three files:
- A file *./src/utils/leap_year.py* with a function that determines if the input is a leap year or not.
A file *./tests/tests_utils/test_leap_year.py* with functions that test the leap year function.
- A doctest file *./tests/tests_utils/test_leap_year.txt* which tests the execution.

After execution of the pytest in command prompt by `python -m pytest .\tests\tests_utils\test_leap_year.py`, 
the following message is displayed.

```
================================= test session starts ====================================

platform win32 -- Python 3.8.3, pytest-6.0.1, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1
rootdir: C:\<name_of_repository_file>, inifile: pytest.ini`<br/>
plugins: dash-1.16.0, cov-2.10.1, typeguard-2.12.0
collected 6 items

tests\test_leap_year.py ......

================================== 6 passed in 0.02s =====================================
```

In this case, all four tests were passed.

### Coverage 
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

A coverage is a metric that indicates the number of code lines covered by tests.  
To implement code coverage, the following possibilities were taken into account:
- Python [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.0.3/) library.
- Python [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) library.
- Commercial solutions [sealights](https://www.sealights.io/agile-testing/test-metrics/python-code-coverage/).
To read more about coverage, please see the Wikipedia page for  
[modified condition/decision coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage).

Of all the options above, it was decided to use Pytest's coverage extension, pytest-cov.
- [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/). The main reason for this choice is the already use of Pytest 
within the repository, implying that a fast implementation of coverage was possible. 
Another reason for this choice is that pytest-cov can additionally calculate the branch coverage.
The used coverage within this repository has been set up to use branch coverage, which checks every line of code and
all possibilities of conditional statements if they were tested.
- See [*Makefile*](#makefile) for available commands.

Usage:
- To view a specific coverage run for a test, open the html file corresponding to the test, which is located in the */coverage* 
folder. This file will open in the browser and allow the user to specifically see which lines are being used and which are not.

<a name="makefile"></a>
# Makefile
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Several make commands were created to make the high level work easier. Please follow
this chapter, because the documentation here is print together with the execution
of the respective make command. After the section name corresponding to make command name, 
please add @ in front of the caption of header printed in command line. The printing function 
then makes it a bit nicer.

# Low-Level Tools
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

A set of tools for working with the repository on the low level was created to allow different setups and monitoring. 

<a name="environment-variables"></a>
## Environment Variables
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Environmental variables control the behaviour of the repository. The class for doing that is placed in 
*/src/utils/envs.py*. Its primary function is to set and get the variables that control the behaviour of the repository.
The methods are the following:  
- `set_config(value: str)`. Sets the name of the environment configuration file to be used.
- `get_config() -> str`. Gets the name of the environment configuration file to be used. If none was set before, 
the default configuration file name is used. The default name is stored in the variable `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, 
which can be found in the file */src/constants/global_constants.py.
- `set_logger(value: str)`. Sets the name of the logger configuration file to be used.
- `get_logger(value: str) -> str`. Gets the name of the logger file to be used. If none was set before, 
the default logger file name is used. The default name is stored in the variable `DEFAULT_LOGGER`, 
which can be found in the file /src/constants/global_constants.py.
- `set_running_unit_tests(value: str = “True”)`. Sets the indicator if in running unit tests mode.
- `get_running_unit_tests() -> str`. Gets the indicator if in running test mode. If none was set before, 
the default value is used. The default name is stored in the variable `DEFAULT_RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS`, 
which can be found in the file */src/constants/global_constants.py*.

For more information, please see the class itself and the 
*notebook /notebooks/documentation/low_level_tools_documentation.py* or 
*/docs/ low_level_tools_documentation.html*.


<a name="environmental-configuration"></a>
## Environmental Configuration
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

During the development, different stages of the project need different set up; for example development, testing , 
and production. Environment configurations allow different setups for different tasks. At this point, 
the following can be configured:
- Paths for storing the data.
- Parameters for parametric notebook execution.
- Configuration for dash.  
The class for reading the configurations is stored in the file */src/utils/config.py*. Singleton pattern was used 
- for the implementation. To get the configuration named tuple, use `config().get()` method. 


For more information, please see the class itself and the 
*notebook /notebooks/documentation/low_level_tools_documentation.py* or 
*/docs/ low_level_tools_documentation.html*.

<a name="timer"></a>
## Timer
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

The timer is a class for measuring execution time. It is placed in /src/utils/timer.py. The logic of the timer is based 
on start, meantimes, and the end. First of all, the timer has to be started. Next, a series of meantimes can be set. 
Each meantime represents the time from the start/previous meantime. Finally, the timer has to be ended. 
The collected data are stored and can be returned. The main methods are the following:  
- `set_results_printing(self, print_results: bool)`. This method sets the option for printing during the execution. 
The default value is True.
- `start()`. Starts the timer.
- `get_meantime(self, label: Union[str, None] = None) -> Tuple[float, float]`. Gets the meantime as duration in seconds 
and minutes. The label of the interval is optional and can be used to put a description of the process.
- `set_meantime(self, label: Union[str, None] = None) -> None`. Sets the meantime and stores it into internal variable.
- `get_end(self, label: Union[str, None]) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]`. Ends the timer by setting the last 
meantime and returns the last meantime in seconds and minutes and the over duration in seconds and minutes.
- `end(self, label: Union[str, None] = None) -> None`. Ends the timer by setting the last meantime and stores the values 
into internal variable.
- `get_start_time(self) -> float`. Returns the start of the measurement.
- `get_end_time(self) -> float`. Retunrs the end of the measurement.
- `get_data(self) -> Tuple[List[float], List[float], List[str]]`. Returns the collected data.

For more information, please see the class itself and the 
*notebook /notebooks/documentation/low_level_tools_documentation.py* or 
*/docs/ low_level_tools_documentation.html*.

<a name="logger"></a>
## Logger
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

A logger was created for code monitoring. The standard logging library is used as a base. The class Logger uses a singleton pattern. There are three pre-defined logger configurations. Please see the Environmental variables section to see how to set them up. The configuration files are stored in /configurations.
- *logger_file.conf*. Logged information is saved only into a file.
- *logger_file_console.conf*. Logged information is saved into the file and, at the same time, printed into to console.
- *logger_file_console_dash.conf*. There is a separate logger configuration for the dash.
The methods are the following:
- `debug(self, message: str) -> None`.
- `info(self, message: str) -> None`.
- `warning(self, message: str) -> None`.
- `error(self, message: str) -> None`.
- `critical(self, message: str) -> None`.
In addition, the logger uses the timer to monitor the time complexity of the tasks. For more information, please see the Timer section; the methods are named accordingly.
- `start_timer(self, process_name: str) -> None`.
- `set_meantime(self, message: str) -> None`.
- `end_timer(self) -> None`.

For more information, please see the class itself and the 
*notebook /notebooks/documentation/low_level_tools_documentation.py* or 
*/docs/ low_level_tools_documentation.html*.

# Jupyter Notebooks
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Jupyter notebooks are the center point of the project. They represent the workflow of the analysis, 
documentation of the process, simulations, they contain results. Their main use is as a client-server pattern. 
There is not important code stored in the notebooks there. The main code is outside in a separate codebase 
(client) and the notebooks are only using this code (server) to produce the outcome.

<a name="jupytext-library"></a>
## Jupytext Library
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

The Jupyter notebook native format is *.ipynb, but they can be converted into different formats as *.html 
and *.pdf files. The native *.ipynb format is not suitable for usage within the version control system, 
because except the code itself, it contains a lot of metadata that makes it hard to follow the changes. 
That is the reason for using [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. 
This library allows storing the notebooks as plain *.py files, so that the tracking of changes is much easier.

To use Jupytext in general, do the following:
- Open an existing Jupyter notebook notebook or add a new one.
- Go to Jupyter notebook settings Edit/Edit Notebook Metadata/.
- Update the metadata to the following format.
    ```
    {
        "jupytext": {"formats": "ipynb,py:light"},
        "kernelspec": {
        "name": "python3",
        "display_name": "Python 3",
        "language": "python"
    },
    ```
- Two parallel files are then available; *.ipynb, *.py. 

Within the repository, in the folder for Jupyter notebooks (notebooks), 
the *.ipynb are excluded from synchronisation with the server. This is specified in .gitignore file.

<a name="jupyter-notebooks-folders"></a>
## Jupyter Notebooks Folders
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

There is a short description in [*Files and Folders Structure*](#files-and-folders-structure) chapter there. It will be discussed in more 
details here to understand the flow and importance of respective folders.
- template
    - There are four template Jupyter notebooks for general usage in this folder there, all set up with
Jupytext library:  
        - template_notebook_empty.py. This is only empty notebook with Jupytext library settings, so it is stored in *.py pair file format.
        - template_notebook_repo.py. This is a raw notebook template which works within the repository and contains the basic functionality.
        - template_notebook_final.py. Notebook template ready for usage as a final notebook, with all the repository functionality and formatting.
        - template_parameterized_execution_notebook.py. Please see [*Parameterized Notebooks*](#parameterized-notebooks) 
    chapter for more information about running parameterized notebooks.
- documentation
     - This folder serves as a storage for Jupyter notebooks with the documentation of some specific 
functionality. Their exported *.html versions created when the functionality is finished can be found in the 
folder /docs, so that the code and usage can be used directly without necessity of running the notebook. 
These *.html files are updated every time the documentation Jupyter notebook is changed/updated.
- raw
    - Only preparation code is stored in this folder. 
- final
    - The most important code. The main delivery and documentation notebooks are kept in this folder.
- temporal
    - All *.py and *.ipynb are excluded for synchronisation in this folder. The folder is used for simulation and running notebooks without affecting the changes in repository itself.

<a name="jupyter-notebook-template"></a>
## Jupyter Notebook Template
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

As mentioned before, there is a notebook /notebooks/template/tempalate_notebook_final.py there in the repository. This notebook is used for all the final notebooks. The notebook uses the functionality mentioned in previous chapters, namely Envs, Config, and Logger.
The notebook is divided into four main parts.
- Notebook Description. The general description of the notebook can be found here.
- GENERAL SETTINGS. This section is meant to be used for the overall notebook setting. All the imports should be here, all the notebook constants, so that the code in the next section of the notebook can be run without any changes.
- ANALYSIS. The main code is supposed to be placed here. The code should be imported from files; no critical code should be placed in the notebook.
- Final Timestamp. The notebook is marked with timestamps at the beginning and at the end. A summary is placed in this section.

<a name="parameterized-notebooks"></a>
## Parameterized Notebooks
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

During the simulation stage, a need of running one notebook with different parameter values can arrise. 
In this case, a [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) library is very useful. 
There are two files created for this case:
- A script src/utils/param_notebook_executioner.py, which contains the class for running the parameterized notebook. The parameters can be specified in the config file or can be set up directly in the file. Running the scripts runs the following example notebook.
- An example notebook notebooks/template/template_parameterized_execution_notebook.py. This notebook is executed when the former script is run. The notebook also contains a guide on how to set up parameters in the notebook to be specified in the scripts.

<a name="ready-to-use-functionality"></a>
# Ready-to-Use Functionality
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

After having the primary codebase ready, the tools for the data science and machine learning tasks were developed on top. 

<a name="visualisations"></a>
## Visualisations
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Visualisations are a necessary part of the data science analytical process. A list of basic plot types was created to 
serve for the analysis. A plotly library was chosen as a base. The reason is that the library is HTML based, 
and all the plots are interactive. That works nicely in the Jupyter notebook. What is more, these plots can be 
incorporated into Dash dashboarding tool, which can then serve as an initial tool for designing the UI and tuning the 
product's functionality. For more information, see the Dash section.  

To see the set of possible plots and their setting, see the notebook 
*/notebooks/documentation/visualisation_documentation.py* or its HTML version in */docs.* 
The code is placed in the folder */src/visualisations*. The usage is extensively described in the notebook, 
together with the proper input and variants of the plots.

<a name="data-frame-explorer"></a>
## Data Frame Explorer
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Pandas data frame is a perfect structure for storing data and exploring data. For that, a class for fast initial data 
frame exploration for created. It is located in the file */src/data/df_explorer*. The class returns:
- Basic information about the data frame as shape, head of the data frame, and data frame description.
- Attribute types.
- NaN statistics.
- Attribute statistics in numbers and charts if the chart has a meaning.
- Data frames comparison for difference and identity testing.  

The functionality is documented in the notebook */notebooks/documentation/data_frame_explorer_documentation.py* or its 
HTML variant in */docs/data_frame_explorer_documentation.html*.

<a name="sample-data-set"></a>
## Sample Data Set
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Income Weather data set is an artificially created data set for testing purposes. The code is in the file 
*/src/data/income_weather_data_generator.py*. The data set consists of the following attributes:  
- DATE. Date of the observation.
- WEATHER. Categorical variable describing the weather during that day.
- TEMPERATURE. That day's temperature.
- RANDOM. The random part of the regression model is created on the top of the data.
- OUTPUT. Regression output for the data.

The data simulates the regression task. The main method generate() returns the following:  
- df_data. Data frame with the basic data.
- df_data_transformed. Data frame with transformed categorical variables (DATE and WEATHER).
- X_multi, Y_multi. More complex, multidimensional regression data.

The functionality is documented in the notebook */notebooks/documentation/ income_weather_data_generator_documentation.py* 
or its HTML variant in */docs/ income_weather_data_generator_documentation.html*.

<a name="time-one-hot-encoding"></a>
## Time One Hot Encoding
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

Seasonality in time series is a phenomenon that has to be properly studied. Depending on the task, it can be in range 
from minutes, over days to months. Using regression, categorical variables reflecting these seasons have to be 
introduced. For that, the time one hot encoding class was created. The code can be found in 
*/src/transformation/datetime_one_hot_transformer.py*. The class allows adding the following time intervals:
- Any amount of minutes.
- Hours.
- Days of week.
- Weekends.
- Months.
- Years.
The functionality is documented in the notebook */notebooks/documentation/ datetime_one_hot_encoder_documentation.py*
or its HTML variant in */docs/ datetime_one_hot_encoder_documentation.html*.

<a name="dash"></a>
# Dash
[ToC](#table-of-content)  

[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) is a framework for building applications in Python and other languages such as R and 
Julia. It is written on the top of [Plotly](https://plotly.com/dash/). As was written in the Visualisation chapter, 
Plotly charts are the essential visualisation tools for data analysis. The benefit is that Dash allows fast and 
effective prototyping of applications on the analysis done. 

The repository contains code for a template HTML dashboarding tool. The code is in the folder /src/apps. A short video 
documenting the functionality is in /docs/dash.mp4.
